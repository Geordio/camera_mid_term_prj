### Camera Mid Term Project Report

### MP.7 Performance Evaluation 1

The performace of each of the keypoint detectors was evaluated. Only the key points in the Region of interest specified were counted, but time measurements were taken for the dtection of keypoints across the complete image.

The table below shows the total number of keypoints generated per detector (I.e the sum of the keypoints generated in each of the 10 images)



The keypoints were plotted onto the images and viewed for assessment.
The application was updated to allow automatic processing of valid combinations, outputing of the results to the terminal in a format that could be saved as a .csv file for further processing.
The saved images can be viewd in the
[output folder](/output)
